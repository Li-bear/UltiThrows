# Application Functionality - UltiThrows

**Overall Description:**

UltiThrows is a project aimed at analyzing ultimate frisbee throws through video input. The application leverages cutting-edge technology to extract statistics from throws, identify the specific throw type (backhand and forehand), and deliver valuable feedback to help players improve their performance.

The project is inspired by video analysis techniques used in sports like tennis, as seen in the following video: [Tennis Video Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-E1tJ9sDF8).

**Specific Functions of the Target App:**

1. Implement pose estimation using MediaPipe for video uploads.
2. Extract and store pose data for analysis.
